64501 and 67461 are roughly 8.25 km apart

From Graf 1993:

Soil 64500 and rake 64510 were collected at Station 4A in the vicinity of Cinco B crater, 
near the rim of a subdued 15 meter crater. The sample area slopes 10-15 degrees to the 
northwest off Stone Mountain, surface fragments up to 10 cm are abundant, up to 40 cm are 
common, up to 1 meter sparse. Scattered craters .5 to several meters are in the general 
area, very subdued and barely visible smaller craters are in the local area. The gray 
surface is underlain by a white layer.

No information in Graf on 67461, but sample was only few m away from these samples:

Reference soil 67840 accompanies rake sample 67510; both were taken on the southeast rim 
of North Ray crater, at Station 11 in the area of the white breccia boulders. The sample 
area is in a local north-south swale, the surface is soft and fine; fragments greater than 
10 cm are sparse and the crew reported "sinking in on the slopes about 6 inches."
