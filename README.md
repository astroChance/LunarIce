# LunarIce ðŸŒ‘
## PhD dissertation work by C. Amos

This repo contains data and workbooks related to my dissertation research within the Space Resources Department at Colorado School of Mines. The objectives of this research are to characterize the impact of water ice on seismic velocity through lunar regolith simulant. The aim of this work is to inform the effectiveness of shallow seismic methods to explore for subsurface ice on the Moon.

This work is divided into two main parts:
1. Evaluate ultrasonic velocity measurements of regolith simulant and compare to Apollo experimental data
2. Characterize the velocity impact of adding water ice to the regolith simulant

Rock physics models and functions used in this work can be found in my [RPutils repository](https://github.com/astroChance/RPutils)
